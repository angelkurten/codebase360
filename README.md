# Centralization and Management of Design Docs in Distributed Architectures: CodeBase360

## Abstract

This paper presents **CodeBase360**, an innovative platform for centralizing and managing technical documents (**design docs**) in distributed architectures. Unlike traditional solutions that primarily focus on a single project or repository, CodeBase360 is aimed at the **comprehensive management of a company’s entire architecture**, including multiple interconnected microservices and systems. The platform provides advanced features such as automatic code generation from design docs, optimizing the development cycle. By covering the entire architecture, its potential impact is significantly greater than solutions focused solely on a single repository. Leveraging semantic search, automatic generation using **GPT-4**, and a robust access control system, the platform enhances collaboration, reduces errors, and optimizes the development lifecycle.

## 1. Introduction

Current tools for code generation and problem-solving are mostly geared toward **individual projects or repositories**, which limits their scope in companies with complex distributed architectures. In environments where services are interconnected, it is crucial to have centralized documentation that is easily accessible and aligned with the actual code.

**CodeBase360** not only centralizes and manages **design docs**, but also automatically generates **code based on technical documentation**, allowing development teams to optimize the implementation process and reduce risks related to the lack of visibility into the dependencies between microservices.

## 2. Problem

Development teams working with microservices face the following challenges:
- **Dispersed access to technical documentation**, which delays decision-making.
- **Lack of consistency** between documentation and real implementation due to manual updates or human errors.
- **Difficulty managing dependencies** between multiple microservices, increasing implementation risks.
- **Inconsistencies in code** due to the manual creation of documents and code, which can lead to misinterpretation errors.

## 3. Proposed Solution: CodeBase360

**CodeBase360** addresses these problems by **centralizing documentation** across the entire architecture of a company’s microservices and automatically generating **code based on approved design docs**. This ensures that technical documentation is always aligned with the code and that teams have access to accurate and up-to-date information. The key functionalities include:

1. **Management of the company’s entire architecture**: Unlike solutions focused on individual projects or repositories, CodeBase360 covers all systems and microservices within an organization, providing comprehensive infrastructure control.

2. **Automatic code generation**: Based on design docs, the platform can generate code templates or blocks for microservices or components. This reduces the time needed to implement new features and ensures consistency between documentation and code.

3. **Dependency visualization**: The tool allows users to visualize the relationships between the company’s systems, improving change planning and preventing conflicts between microservices.

4. **Architecture-level automation**: The ability to generate code and manage documentation across the entire company architecture significantly impacts developers, allowing them to anticipate issues, reduce errors, and increase team efficiency.

## 4. Impact on the Company

The impact of **CodeBase360**, which manages **the company’s entire architecture** instead of being limited to a single project or repository, is significantly greater. The main benefits are:

1. **Development cycle optimization**: Automatic code generation enables developers to focus on more strategic tasks, reducing the time spent on manually creating repetitive code.

2. **Improvement in software quality**: With visibility into all dependencies between microservices, teams can foresee and mitigate issues before they affect the production system, improving software quality.

3. **Cost reduction**: CodeBase360’s comprehensive approach minimizes implementation errors and reduces development time, leading to lower operational costs.

4. **Increased productivity**: Automation and centralization of documentation eliminate the need for repetitive manual tasks, allowing technical teams to work more efficiently and collaboratively.

## 5. Evaluation Based on SWE-Bench

Current models, such as those evaluated on **SWE-bench**, show problem-solving success rates ranging from **45.20%** for advanced models like **Gru** to **38.40%** for solutions like **AutoCodeRover + GPT-4**. These models are designed to solve problems within a specific repository or project. However, **CodeBase360** expands this functionality to encompass the entire infrastructure of a company, increasing its potential impact.

By managing multiple microservices and systems simultaneously, CodeBase360 offers a competitive advantage compared to solutions limited to a single project. In this context, CodeBase360 has the potential to solve more complex problems with a broader scope, directly impacting the organization’s entire architecture.

## 6. Future Expansions

As **CodeBase360** evolves, new functionalities are planned, such as:
- **Integration with CI/CD systems** to automate the deployment of microservices based on design docs.
- **Predictive analysis** to detect potential points of failure in the microservices architecture, using information derived from centralized and automatically generated documentation.
  
## 7. Conclusion

**CodeBase360** represents a significant advancement in the **management of technical documentation at the architectural level**. Unlike solutions focused on individual projects, this tool allows the entire company’s infrastructure to be managed, centralizing design docs and automatically generating code. This ability to encompass an entire company’s microservices architecture improves efficiency, quality, and security in the development lifecycle, offering a tangible impact on productivity and cost reduction.
